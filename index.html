<p>So today I read an article that suggested every developer should have a developer blog. Something about how it encourages one to properly research and understand the stuff you blog about. I've previously had a developer blog but they do require effort to keep them going. It was at <a href="http://splab.blogspot.com/">Java Splan</a>. Feel free to look at it, but it's pretty dated now. I mention it here for posterity. </p>

<p>So I'm going to give it another go, and see how far I get. At the very least it's been fun learning how GitHub pages work.</p>

<a id="why-splab" class="anchor" href="#why-splab" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why Splab?</h3>

<p>When I was a young 'un, I was quite into my surfing. One of the surfing magazines I subscribed to had a column called Daily Splab, or something to that effect, and it always stuck with me as a great term to describe a brain dump of sorts, of a current topic of interest, or experience.</p>

<h3>
<a id="who-are-you" class="anchor" href="#who-are-you" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who are you?</h3>

<p>I'm a middle aged software developer living in Cape Town, South Africa, and as of 2008 I've been the lead platform developer for a small startup called CentraStage, in the UK. Since around 2009'ish, we've hosted our infrastructure on the AWS platform, and it's been a great experience. In August 2014 we were acquired by a US PSA company called Autotask, and it's continued to be a great experience under their watch. They've allowed us to do what we do best, and I hope to use this blog as a way to document stuff I've learned, stuff we've done, and basically just capture my thoughts as a sort of syslog of my mind. Hope somebody else finds it useful as well.</p>
