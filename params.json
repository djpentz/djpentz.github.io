Something about how it encourages one to properly research and understand the stuff you blog about. I've previously had a developer blog but they do require effort to keep them going. It was at [Java Splan](http://splab.blogspot.com/). Feel free to look at it, but it's pretty dated now. I mention it here for posterity. \r\n\r\nSo I'm going to give it another go, and see how far I get. At the very least it's been fun learning how GitHub pages work.","google":"UA-62733726-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
